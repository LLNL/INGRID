Summary and Plans
=================

* A stand-alone tokamak grid generator INGRID is being developed in Python
* It potentially will be useful for a range of edge modeling codes, in the near term for PyUEDGE
* At this point, a range of numerical tools for grid generation has been implemented (bicubic interpolation, magnetic line tracing, root solving)
* A potential problem is the performance (may need to look into parallel implementation, Symplectic Integrators)
