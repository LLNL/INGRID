Why Python?
===========

* In tokamak edge grid generation there are many corner cases that are easier to debug using interactive graphical environment
* Python has advantage as a free, open source language with extensive graphical and numerical libraries and large user base
* Building on experience with IDL-based code Gingred weâ€™ll be able to generate grids with more than one X-point (near-snowflake and others)
* The new code is dubbed INGRID (INteractive GRID generator)
* In near term, will be primarily used as a component of PyUEDGE
* Potentially, as a standalone grid-generator it may be useful for other edge-modeling codes (BOUT++, COGENT, 2DX, OMFIT)
