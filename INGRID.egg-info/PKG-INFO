Description: # INGRID
        Interactive Grid Generator for Tokamak Boundary Region
        
        ## Obtaining INGRID:
        Clone the INGRID repo with the command:
        ```console
        git clone username@https://github.com/LLNL/INGRID.git IngridDir
        ```
        where ``IngridDir`` is the name of your clone destination.
        
        ## Installation prerequisites:
        To run INGRID on your machine, you must have ``anaconda3`` and ``setuptools`` installed
        and up to date. 
        
        ***MacOS Mojave users please read on. Otherwise, continue to the next section.***
        
        MacOS Mojave has issues with certain backend libraries used in INGRID. This has been documented by Apple. To remedy this, a Conda evironment has been created and must be installed by the user. Inside the cloned repo should be the file ``conda_env.yml``. Creating the Conda environment can be done by running:
        ```console
        conda env create -f conda_env.yml
        ```
        Activate the created Conda environment by running:
        ```console
        conda activate ingrid
        ```
        When active, the terminal prompt should begin with ``(ingrid)``.
        
        ## Installing INGRID
        The user can install INGRID via the ``setup.py`` file (***MacOS Mojave users: make sure the ``ingrid`` conda environment is activated***). Installation can be started by running: 
        ```console
        python setup.py install --user
        ```
        
        ## Example cases
        Included in the ``example_files`` directory are some test cases for Ingrid usuage.
        
        ### Running GUI from drivers
        Navigate into the ``drivers`` directory.
        ```console
        python StartGUI.py
        ```
        From here a user can select an example case from ``example_files`` or create a new case by utilizing a template file.
        
        ### Running GUI from CL
        Running the gui directly from a python session can be done as follows:
        ```python
        from INGRID import ingrid
        ingrid.QuickStart()
        ```
