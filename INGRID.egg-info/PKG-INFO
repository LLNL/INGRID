Description: # INGRID
        Interactive Grid Generator for Tokamak Boundary Region
        
        ## Installing the INGRID Conda Environment:
        Dependencies required to run this code are found in the "conda_env.yml" file. The first line of the yml file sets the new environment's name. This is set to _**ingrid**_ by default.
        With the Conda package manager installed on your system, navigate to the cloned Ingrid root directory and run:
        ```console
        conda env create -f conda_env.yml
        ```
        
        If no edits were made to the provided .yml file, ctivate the newly created Conda environment by running:
        ```console
        conda activate ingrid
        ```
        
        Otherwise, run:
        ```console
        conda activate MY_ENV_NAME
        ```
        
        ## Example cases
        Included in the **Examples** directory are test cases for Ingrid usuage.
