# target_plates:
#     Settings for all target plates to be

#
#     plate_E1: (dict) Plate EAST of primary x-point (where NORTH

#
#     plate_W1: (dict) Plate WEST of primary x-point (where NORTH

#
#     file: (str) Text file containing coordinates defining a target
#            plate.
#
#     name: (str) User-defined name associated with plate.
#
#     np_local: (int) Number of POLOIDAL cells to generate within
#                patches adjacent to the respective target plate.
#
#     nr_local: (int) Number of RADIAL cells to generate within

#
#     poloidal_f: (str) User defined function for 'distortion' of
#                  cell placement within a target plate.
#
#     USAGE OF "poloidal_f":
#                 - The sequence of characters before ',' must
#                   denote the variable name VAR to operate upon.
#
#                 - Place a user-defined mathematical expression
#                   after the ',' delimiter utilizing the variable
#                   VAR defined before-hand.
#
#                 - The package SymPy is used to convert user-input 
#                   to a mathematical expression. This requires the 
#                   input to be a valid Python expression. 
#
#                 - For detailed information on available functions,
#                   see Sympy docs pertaining to "Functions" module.
