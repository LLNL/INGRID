This test verifies interpolation of Psi in INGRID. The poloidal flux
Psi is imported from an eqdsk file where it is defined on a cartesian
grid in R,Z. Bicubic interpolation is used to calculate Psi and its
derivatives at an arbitrary location within the original R,Z
domain. In the test the original Psi is interpolated to a different
cartesian grid, and contour plots of original Psi and interpolated Psi
are shown together, demonstrating close agreement.


Run the test as follows:
python -i e2d_gridue.py
