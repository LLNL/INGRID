Welcome to INGRID's documentation
=================================

INGRID (**IN**\ teractive \ **GRID**) is a Python based tokamak edge plasma grid generator capable of automatic generation of grids for magnetic-topologies with up to two x-points anywhere in the domain. The code can be operated in both a GUI mode and within scripts. 

This documentation will get a user up and running with operating INGRID in GUI mode. For operating INGRID via scripts, API documentation has been generated (see Module Documentation). 

The INGRID code is maintained by LLNL PLS-FESP. Issues with the code be brought to the attention of the current maintainers Bryan Garcia (UCSC), Maxim Umansky (LLNL), and Jerome Guterl (GA).
