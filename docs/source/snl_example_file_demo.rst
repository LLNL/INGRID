**********************************
Example: single-null configuration
**********************************

.. warning:: This tutorial assumes INGRID has been launched from the provided GUI driver. See page :doc:`launching_ingrid` for explaination.

Here we will demonstrate how to generate a grid for a lower single-null (``SNL``) configuration. This tutorial aims to:

* Explain the GUI capabilities
* Illustrate the INGRID workflow (data analysis :math:`\rightarrow` patch-generation :math:`\rightarrow` grid-generation :math:`\rightarrow` exporting gridue)
* Expose the user to key parameter-file controls (see parameter-file documentation for further details)

.. note:: Although we are creating a lower single-null grid here, INGRID internally treats both lower and upper single-null configurations as ``SNL`` class instances. This means there is *no difference in user operation for generating a grid for either LSN or USN configurations.* 

Loading our first example
=========================

After `getting the INGRID GUI up and running <launching_ingrid>`_, click the GUI button labeled "Select Parameter File" shown below boxed in red.

.. image:: figures/ingrid_gui_select_param.png

From here, your machine's native file navigator should be on the screen. Navigate into the directory ``example_files`` the cloned repository to find a collection of example-cases we used for showcasing INGRID's capabilities (as well as for testing the product). 

Now navigate into directory ``SNL`` and select the file ``DIIID_SNL.yml``. The GUI should now be updated with the loaded path to the example-file we selected as seen below boxed in red.

.. image:: figures/ingrid_gui_snl_loaded.png

INGRID has now processed the selected parameter-file. Some (of many) actions taken automatically by INGRID include:

* Processing of paths to data (``EFIT``, geometry, patch-data, etc.)
* Loading of ``EFIT`` data
* Loading of strike-geometry (target plates and/or limiter)
* Refining of x-point coordinates
* Refining of magnetic-axis coordinates
* Initialization of visualization settings

With the data loaded, we can now proceed.

Viewing loaded data
===================

To view the ``EFIT`` data, loaded strike-geometry, and psi-levels that will dictate our final grid, simply select "View Loaded File" shown below boxed in red.

.. image:: figures/ingrid_gui_view_loaded_file.png

Once clicked, we are greeted with a new plot window showing the DIII-D data we have loaded. 

.. image:: figures/snl_demo_diiid_raw.png
    :scale: 50 %

Here are some key items that INGRID has plotted (as seen in the legend):

* **Refined** primary x-point coordinate as an orange '+' marker (``xpt1``)
* **Refined** magnetic-axis coordinate as a yellow '+' marker (``magx``)
* **Normalized** ``eqdsk`` data as black and white filled contours (psi-value of 0 at ``magx`` and psi-value of 1 at ``xpt1``)
* ``plate_W1`` data as a dark blue line (LSN inner target plate)
* ``plate_E1`` data as an orange line (LSN outer target plate)
* The primary separatrix (red contour line)
* SOL boundary (lime contour line)
* CORE boundary (cyan contour line)
* PRIVATE-FLUX boundary (white contour line)

.. note:: The user provides the approximate primary x-point coordinates (``rxpt1``, ``zxpt1``), and magnetic axis coordinates (``rmagx``, ``zmagx``) in the INGRID parameter file. INGRID takes these as an initial guess to provide to a root-finder in order to **refine** the user-provided coordinates to high-accuracy. These values are used internally throughout the user-session.

This stage is where the user will interact the most with the INGRID parameter file (tweaking psi-values, target-plate locations, limiter data, etc). Said settings will be used to generate the patch map we will see in the next section. Since these have already been provided for you, let us proceed to creating patches.

Creating patches
================

INGRID interally uses a geometry object hierarchy (``Point`` :math:`\in` ``Line`` :math:`\in` ``Patch`` :math:`\in` ``TopologyUtils``) to generate the final gridue file. We will now create a collection of ``Patch`` objects. These ``Patch`` objects are quadrilaterals that form a *partition* of the region we are interested in generating a grid for. Before elaborating further, let us now create said collection of patches (referred to as a *Patch map*) by clicking the GUI button labeled "Create Patches" shown below boxed in red.

.. image:: figures/ingrid_gui_create_patches.png

Once clicked, INGRID begins line-tracing in order to generate the Patch map seen below.

.. image:: figures/snl_demo_patches.png
    :scale: 50 %

The collection of ``Patch`` objects are pictured in the Patch map. These ``Patch`` objects will generate their own subgrid that will be stitched together to form the exported global grid.

Saving ``Patch`` data
=====================

INGRID provides the user the capability of saving ``Patch`` data into a specially formatted NumPy ``npy`` files for later reconstruction. We control this feature within the parameter file by modifying the entries under ``patch_data`` (seen below):

.. code-block:: YAML

    # ---------------------------------------------------
    # Saved patch settings
    # ---------------------------------------------------
    patch_data:
      file: LSN_patches_1597099640.npy
      preferences:
        new_file: true
        new_fname: LSN_patches_1597099640.npy
      use_file: false

Here we have:

* ``file`` - the name of the file to use for ``Patch`` reconstruction
* ``preferences`` - settings for configuring final ``Patch`` data file

    * ``new_file`` - create a new ``Patch`` data file
    * ``new_fname`` - name of new ``Patch`` data file

* ``use_file`` - use the provided file for ``Patch`` reconstruction

.. note:: Remember to set the directory to search for a ``Patch`` data *file* by modifying ``patch_data`` under entry ``dir_settings``

Because the parameter file is populated with the above settings, we see that after creation of a ``Patch`` map the terminal prompts the user with a message stating:
::
    # Saved patch data for file LSN_patches_1597099640.npy

The user is encouraged to try this feature out. To do so, first change the ``use_file`` entry within ``patch_data`` to a value of ``True`` and save the file. Now, close the ``Patch`` map window, and click ``Create Patches`` again. The ``Patch`` map should now be restored back to the state it was at.

.. tip:: ``Patch`` data files expedite the grid generation process by bypassing all line-tracing. This feature is also useful for trading cases with other INGRID users

.. _patch-map-ref:

The ``Patch`` map
=================

In the above plot we can see the "``Patch`` map". Each ``Patch`` is been assigned it's own color, as well as a ``Patch`` label/tag consisting of a two-character string of the form "<alpha_char><numeric_char>"". This coding directly represents the index space of the final grid with: 

* The alpha-char ("A", "B", ..., "F" here) representing a poloidal "column" in the index space.
* The numeric-char ("1" and "2" here) representing a radial "row" in the index space. 

Below is diagram illustrating said notation.

.. image:: figures/snl_demo_patches_index_space.png

This notation proves to be robust since it holds for not only ``SNL`` topologies (both LSN and USN), but also all topologies such as ``UDN`` and the family ``SF*``.

For the ``SNL`` family of configurations, the collection of ``Patch`` objects with numeric_char == "2" ("**A2**" - "**F2**") represent the SOL, ``Patch`` objects "**A1**" and "**F1**" represent the PF region, and ``Patch`` objects "**B1**", "**C1**", "**D1**", and "**E1**" represent the CORE.

.. note:: We will use this notation extensively for fine-tuning the final grid

.. tip:: ``Patch`` objects are ordered alphabetically clock-wise around the magnetic-axis and enumerated in direction of increasing psi

Now that we have partitioned the EFIT domain into the region we wish to model, let us now generate a grid.

Creating a grid
===============

Before generating a grid, let's take a look at some grid controls in the INGRID parameter file. 

Below are some entries we will be modifying.

.. code-block:: YAML

    # ---------------------------------------------------
    # General grid settings
    # ---------------------------------------------------
    grid_settings:
      # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      # Settings for grid generation (num cells, transforms, distortion_correction)
      # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      grid_generation:
        distortion_correction:
          all:
            active: True # true, 1 also valid.
            resolution: 1000
            theta_max: 120.0
            theta_min: 80.0
        np_default: 3
        nr_default: 3
        # Other grid settings

Within the entry ``grid_settings``, we have:

* ``grid_generation`` - settings for controlling resultant grid
    
    * ``distortion_correction`` - settings for controlling shearing in grid
    
    * ``np_default`` - default number of poloidal cells per ``Patch``
    * ``nr_default`` - default number of radial cells per ``Patch``

.. note:: We will work with entry ``distortion_correction`` at a later time (next section). For now, set the entry value to ``False`` so that we can see it's effects later

To execute refinement of the ``Patch`` map into a grid, we click the GUI button ``Create Grid``.

.. image:: figures/ingrid_gui_create_grid.png

The terminal will prompt the user with the progress of ``Patch`` refinement by providing a short summary of the subgrid being generated within each ``Patch``. When ``Patch`` refinement has finalized, we are greeted with a new window showing the resultant grid.

.. image:: figures/snl_demo_grid_default.png
    :scale: 50 %

Although this grid can be immediately exported, there are still actions we can take to improve our grid naively generated with only ``np_default`` and ``nr_default``.


Fine-tuning the grid
====================

Generating grids with global values ``np_default`` and ``nr_default`` is not enough in many cases. INGRID allows users to specify the number of poloidal and radial cells for particular regions of the ``Patch`` map. This allows for refining the grid near regions of interest while maintaining global/default grid values per ``Patch``.

To utilize this feature, we will fall back on the ``Patch`` naming convention explained in section :ref:`patch-map-ref`. The figure below shows a collection of keyword entries (``np_A``, ``np_B``, ... ``np_F``, ``nr_1``, ``nr_2``) that can be added to the INGRID parameter file to control the number cells in a grid.

.. image:: figures/snl_index_map_np_nr.png

Note how modifying ``np_A`` would affect both "A2" and "A1" since they are poloidally dependent in index-space. Similarly, we see how modifying ``np_1`` would affect "A1" - "F1" since they are radially dependent in index-space.

Let's illustrate this idea by increasing the number of poloidal cells near both target plates. We see by inspecting the ``Patch`` map that target plates border patches "A*" and "F*". This says we must add entries ``np_A`` and ``np_F`` to the INGRID parameter file. That is:

.. code-block:: YAML

    # ---------------------------------------------------
    # General grid settings
    # ---------------------------------------------------
    grid_settings:
      # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      # Settings for grid generation (num cells, transforms, distortion_correction)
      # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      grid_generation:
        distortion_correction:
          all:
            active: false # true, 1 also valid.
            resolution: 1000
            theta_max: 120.0
            theta_min: 80.0

        np_A: 9  # Create 9 poloidal cells in patches A1 and A2
        np_F: 9  # Create 9 poloidal cells in patches F1 and F2

        np_default: 3
        nr_default: 3
        # Other grid settings

In addition to refining poloidally, let's increase the radial resolution near the target plates. In this case "A2" and "A1" are *not* dependent on each other (as seen in figure above). On the other hand, since the SOL consists of all patches with numeric-tag "2", modifying "A2" in radial cells will modify all other patches in the SOL radially to keep the index-map consisitent. We will choose to refine "A2". That is:

.. code-block:: YAML

    # ---------------------------------------------------
    # General grid settings
    # ---------------------------------------------------
    grid_settings:
      # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      # Settings for grid generation (num cells, transforms, distortion_correction)
      # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      grid_generation:
        distortion_correction:
          all:
            active: false # true, 1 also valid.
            resolution: 1000
            theta_max: 120.0
            theta_min: 80.0

        np_A: 9  # Create 9 poloidal cells in patches A1 and A2
        np_F: 9  # Create 9 poloidal cells in patches F1 and F2

        nr_2: 6  # Create 6 radial cells in layer 2

        np_default: 3
        nr_default: 3
        # Other grid settings

After making the addition, save the file and click "Create Grid". INGRID will detect that an edit was made to the parameter file and apply all changes. When ``Patch`` refinement has finalized, we are greeted with a new window showing the updated grid.

.. image:: figures/snl_demo_grid_plates.png
    :scale: 50 %

We can continue to modify the grid in order to allocate more cells near the x-point. A natural choice would be to target ``np_B`` and ``np_E``. Doing so with the values ``np_B = 18`` and ``np_E = 18`` (double resolution for the larger patches), we see our parameter file consists of:

.. code-block:: YAML

    # ---------------------------------------------------
    # General grid settings
    # ---------------------------------------------------
    grid_settings:
      # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      # Settings for grid generation (num cells, transforms, distortion_correction)
      # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      grid_generation:
        distortion_correction:
          all:
            active: false # true, 1 also valid.
            resolution: 1000
            theta_max: 120.0
            theta_min: 80.0

        np_A: 9  # Create 9 poloidal cells in patches A1 and A2
        np_F: 9  # Create 9 poloidal cells in patches F1 and F2
        np_B: 18  # Create 18 poloidal cells in patches B1 and B2
        np_E: 18  # Create 18 poloidal cells in patches E1 and E2

        nr_2: 6  # Create 6 radial cells in layer 2

        np_default: 3
        nr_default: 3
        # Other grid settings

and produces a grid that we can see below (zoomed with Matplotlib toolbar provided in plots).

    :scale: 50 %

We will explore one more useful feature the user can control during grid generation: ``distortion_correction``. 

Reducing cell shearing with ``distortion_correction``
=====================================================

INGRID does not enforce an orthogonality condition when generating a grid. Non-orthogonal grids in INGRID allow for generation of grids that conform entirely to plate/limiter geometry. Although non-orthogonal grids can generate some cell shearing/distortion in certain cases (see figures below), INGRID allows the user to mitigate these effects with the ``distortion_correction`` feature. 

Below is an example of cell shearing and ``distortion_correction`` activated.
