Bicubic Interpolation
=====================

The Test_Interpol module contains a function that, when called, provides a demonstration 
of bicubic interpolation of a given function/ It accepts 3 parameters: option = 2, nfine = 100, 
and ncrude = 10.
Option specifies which mathematical function we are going to use to test the interpolation. 
Accepts 1, 11, 12, 13, 2, 3, and 4.
nfine and ncrude are the densities of the fine and crude grids that will be used. 
The function is first plotted with the fine grid to give us a picture of what we are looking for. 
This is in black. Then the function is evaluated on the crude grid, 
then interpolates to get values inbetween the grid points. 
The interpolation is done along the fine grid. This will show up a couple seconds later in red.
